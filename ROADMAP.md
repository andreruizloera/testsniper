# Roadmap

Concrete future work, none of it implemented yet.

## Near term

- PyPI release so `pip install testsniper` works without git.
- Stream pytest output live instead of capturing and reprinting it.
- `--dry-run-command` flag that prints the exact pytest invocation for
  copy-pasting into other tools.
- Read `testpaths` from `setup.cfg` and `tox.ini` in addition to
  `pyproject.toml` and `pytest.ini`.
- `--json` output for editor and CI integrations.

## Selection quality

- Test-node granularity: select individual test functions when a changed
  module is only used by part of a file, likely as a pytest plugin
  (`-p testsniper`) so collection-time deselection is exact.
- Fixture awareness: trace which fixtures a test uses and which modules
  those fixtures import, catching dependencies that skip the import
  statement in the test file itself.
- Hybrid mode: consume a coverage map (pytest-cov contexts) when one
  exists and fall back to the import graph when it does not.
- Namespace package (PEP 420) support; today a missing `__init__.py`
  stops the module name walk.
- Track `importlib.import_module` calls with literal string arguments
  instead of just degrading confidence.

## Performance

- Cache the import graph keyed by file content hashes so repeated runs
  only rescan changed files.
- Optional pytest-xdist integration to parallelize the selected subset.

## Workflow

- `--watch` mode: rerun the selection whenever a file changes.
- A ready-made pre-push git hook and a GitHub Actions example that runs
  the sniped subset on pull requests and the full suite on main.
