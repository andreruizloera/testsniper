# Roadmap

Concrete future work. Everything listed below is unimplemented; the one
place a shipped feature is named, it is named as shipped and only to say
what it stops short of.

## Near term

- PyPI release so `pip install testsniper` works without git.
- Stream pytest output live instead of capturing and reprinting it.
- `--dry-run-command` flag that prints the exact pytest invocation for
  copy-pasting into other tools.
- Read `testpaths` from `setup.cfg` and `tox.ini` in addition to
  `pyproject.toml` and `pytest.ini`.
- `--json` output for editor and CI integrations.
- `--write-plan PATH` so a selection computed on one machine can be applied
  by `pytest --testsniper-plan` on another (the plan records an absolute
  repository root today, so this needs a relocation rule first).

## Selection quality

Test-node granularity shipped: `--nodes` and the `--testsniper` plugin
select individual test functions. The items below are what it does not do
yet.

- Cross-file fixture graph. Fixtures are followed inside a file today. A
  fixture in a `conftest.py` is handled by refusing to narrow anything under
  that conftest when it is affected, which is safe but blunt: resolving which
  tests actually request that fixture would keep narrowing on for the rest.
- Fixture awareness for plugin-provided fixtures, which no amount of AST
  reading can attribute to a test.
- Diff-hunk narrowing for a changed test file. Today a changed test file runs
  in full; the diff says which functions moved.
- Narrow on the changed symbol, not just the changed module: a test that uses
  only `pricing.line_total` does not need to run when only
  `pricing.price_with_tax` changed.
- Follow `self.attr` set in a fixture or `setup_method`, which the class-level
  propagation currently only approximates.
- Hybrid mode: consume a coverage map (pytest-cov contexts) when one
  exists and fall back to the import graph when it does not.
- Namespace package (PEP 420) support; today a missing `__init__.py`
  stops the module name walk.
- Track `importlib.import_module` calls with literal string arguments
  instead of just degrading confidence.

## Performance

- Cache the import graph keyed by file content hashes so repeated runs
  only rescan changed files.
- Optional pytest-xdist integration to parallelize the selected subset.

## Workflow

- `--watch` mode: rerun the selection whenever a file changes.
- A ready-made pre-push git hook and a GitHub Actions example that runs
  the sniped subset on pull requests and the full suite on main.
